# Structure


The `beep structure` command takes in *N* raw battery cycler files (mostly text or csv) and produces *N* structured data json files.

The structured json files can be loaded either with the BEEP python `BEEPDatapath` interface (see [Advanced Structuring](/tutorial2/)) or with subsequent CLI commands such as `beep featurize` (see [CLI - Featurize](/Command%20Line%20Interface/3%20-%20featurize/)).

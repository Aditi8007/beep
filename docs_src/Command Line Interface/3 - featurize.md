```sh
$: beep featurize --help

Usage: beep featurize [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

  Featurize one or more files. Argument is a space-separated list of files or
  globs. The same features are applied to each file. Naming of outputfiles is
  done automatically, but the output directory can be specified.

Options:
  -o, --output-filename FILE      Filename to save entre feature matrix to. If
                                  not specified, output filewill be named with
                                  FeatureMatrix-[timestamp].json.gz. If
                                  specified, overrides the output dir for
                                  saving the feature matrix to file.
  -d, --output-dir DIRECTORY      Directory to dump auto-named files to.
  -f, --featurize-with TEXT       Specify a featurizer to apply by class name,
                                  e.g. HPPCResistanceVoltageFeatures. To apply
                                  more than one featurizer, use multiple -f
                                  <FEATURIZER> commands. To applyall core BEEP
                                  featurizers, pass the value 'all'. Note if
                                  'all_features' or 'all_targets' is passed,
                                  other -f featurizers will be ignored. All
                                  feautrizers are attempted to apply with
                                  default hyperparameters; to specify your own
                                  hyperparameters, use --featurize-with-
                                  hyperparams.Classes from installed modules
                                  not in core BEEP can be specified with the
                                  class name in absolute import format, e.g.,
                                  my_package.my_module.MyClass.
  -h, --featurize-with-hyperparams TEXT
                                  Specify a featurizer to apply by class name
                                  with your own hyperparameters.(such as
                                  parameter directories or specific values for
                                  hyperparametersfor this featurizer), pass a
                                  dictionary in the format:
                                  '{"FEATURIZER_NAME": {"HYPERPARAM1":
                                  "VALUE1"...}}' including the single quotes
                                  around the outside and double quotes for
                                  internal strings.Custom hyperparameters will
                                  be merged with default hyperparameters if
                                  the hyperparameter dictionary is
                                  underspecified.
  --save-intermediates            Save the intermediate BEEPFeaturizers as
                                  json files. Filenames are autogenerated and
                                  saved in output-dir if specified; otherwise,
                                  intermediates are written to current working
                                  directory.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
